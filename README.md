## Components & Subsystems

### Hypersonic Sensor (HC-SR04)
The first subsystem involves taking an external signal as input and performing speed and distance calculations from that signal. I chose a hypersonic sensor that uses the Doppler shift to calculate these data values. Much like the Doppler-shift Compensation behavior that bats exhibit for echolocation, the hypersonic sensor emits a sonic burst of 8 pulses of a few microseconds and waits for an "echo" to determine distance traveled, and from there the speed of the object.

I chose the [HC-SR04 module](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/datasheets/Sensors/Proximity/HCSR04.pdf) for its ease of use and its relatively low price point.
